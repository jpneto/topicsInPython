A program herein is a set of logical expressions stating facts and rules.\n","\n","A **fact** is some an atomic formula (with no logic operations, except negation) that is assumed true.\n","\n","A **rule** is an implication with form\n","\n","$$H \\leftarrow B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_n$$\n","\n","where $B_i$ are atomic formulas that need to be true in order to $H$ to be true (sometimes $H$ is called the head and the set of $B_i$ the body).\n","\n","This rule can be seen as\n","\n","+ a logical implication: $B_1$ and $B_2$ and ... implies $H$\n","\n","+ a program: to solve $H$ you must solve $B_1$, then $B_2$, ...\n","\n","To solve a certain problem we need to write it into a collection of rules and facts, that is, we need to translate it into a logical statement.\n","\n","This statement is what is called a **logic program**. A computation over a logic program is the deduction of some of its implications/consequences.\n","\n","**Querying** a logic program is finding if some logic expression is one of the program's consequences. Usually, in answering the query we also get a model, that is, the concrete values that makes the expression a consequence of the program."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"J9Nlfwa3etFF"},"source":["These queries are computed via a backtracking algoritm called **unification** that attempts to match parts of the query with clauses from the available rules and facts. If the algorithm is able to match the query it succeeds, otherwise it fails.\n","\n","Due to the backtracking nature of unification, the algorithm is able to provide all possible combinations of facts that satisfy a given query.\n","\n","Despite the declarative nature of logic programs, there is also an imperative perspective. Unification, while replacing (or _rewriting_) part of the query with a possible match, can be seen as performing a tree depth-first search over the collection of rules and facts. So, the order of how the rules (and the clauses within rules) are listed on the program determines how the tree search will occur. \n","\n","Different orderings might result in enormous differences in efficiency, and even in program correction due to nontermination (if depth-first becomes locked inside the exploration of an infinite tree branch). This is a serious [leaky abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction) that logic programmers must always consider.\n","\n","Logic languages also have an operator that allows the search termination on some branches of the tree (because the programmer knows that a search there will be useless). Also, the judicious use of this operator (called the cut operator), used for computation eficiency and/or termination, represents a side-effect that contaminates the pure declarative nature of a logic program."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eRDeJ-mahJ0i"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KYr6wehgehYC"},"source":["The most famous example of a Logic Programming language is Prolog. \n","\n","Here we will use the Prolog implemetation, `swipl`, which has an interface to Python, `pyswip`:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"_BozB3lHLMOG"},"source":["# On Windows:\n","# 1. install swipl @ https://www.swi-prolog.org/\n","# 2. add swipl exe to PATH\n","!sudo apt install swi-prolog #
