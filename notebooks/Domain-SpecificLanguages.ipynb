Famous examples include HTML, CSS, SQL, Latex, Markdown, regex, BNF, Make, Maven, Dot, among many many others. Not all DSLs are meant to be executed, like UML, but most are.\n","\n","The frontier between DSLs and GPLs is not well-defined, being more of a spectrum where languages fit more or less to each side. Arguments can be made that Cobol is a DSL for business applications, or Mathematica is a DSL for doing mathematics, but many classify them as GPLs.\n","\n","Another distinction can be made between domain-specific APIs and domain-specific languages. One example, in probabilistic programming, is between [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/), a Python module with a rich API to perform probabilistic reasoning, and [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) which includes a DSL for describing probabilistic models. Both tools solve the same type of problems, but using different perspectives.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"49IeTYyAzlrD"},"source":["## Creating a DSL"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"j5lQuwkE3e6Z"},"source":["Crafting DSLs is not a trivial task.
